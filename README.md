# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python. The implementation utilizes `scikit-learn` for PCA decomposition and includes visualizations with `bokeh` and `matplotlib`.

## Features
- Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Visualize principal components
- Apply PCA on sample datasets
- Interactive visualization using `bokeh`

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib bokeh
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCA_Implementation.git
   cd PCA_Implementation
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PCA_Implementation.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells to see PCA in action.

## Code Structure
- **`PCA_Implementation.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the PCA implementation and visualization.
- **`pca_utils.py`** (if applicable): Utility functions for PCA visualization.

## Example
A sample dataset is provided and transformed using PCA.


## Results
- The principal components are computed and displayed.
- Visualizations help understand data transformation in lower dimensions.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by adding new features or optimizing the implementation. Fork the repository and submit a pull request.
